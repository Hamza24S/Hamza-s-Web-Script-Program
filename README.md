So I used the TA's example and the code that we worked on in class to get a basic grasp of how to work the website.
I used several videos to better understand concepts and because it helps me to see how differnet elements in html and css are being used. This helped me a lot to put  my own twist on how things run.
I used the following videos for reference, This is from LearnCode.Academy,"https://youtu.be/iXSSHlOe47s?si=vukXISiw4g_ec8jr".
And these two videos are from Bro Code "https://youtu.be/HD13eq_Pmp8?si=Z3h-LFMisb1Htj6d", and "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRNinF7YQqQ".
I also used [this website](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) along with the lecture slides to understand what all tags mean and how they are being implemented. This helped me as I was able to understand what
tags or elements for HTML and CSS are good for me to use for this project.
